    <h1>Late Night Snack</h1>
    <p>Hello, it has been a long time. I've had this in mind for so so long but I guess now's a good time as any. You know who I am, not really anything out of the norm just an ordinary person. Yet this place is for an online persona, so do not think "but this isn't you". Obviously it is not. It is just a part of it. 

The reason why I do this, or even building the site in the first place, is because I want to somehow push myself into thinking new "stuff". 
Which is difficult because my definiton of original is quite limited. Well, on the area I want to think anyway .


A person who just met me might think that I'm a "philosophical person" which is most of the time bullshit and I'm messing with them. What people consider philosophical is usually trivial information or tricks. Nevertheless I would like to have ideas and amateurly- as if there is a professional way of thinking- I practice on what I would consider my field. I have these thoughts mostly during the night, where I feel most alone with myself so it helps me think. Hence the name late night snack. I have no idea how any other people learn or think and create but for me it is an highly personal task. 
So most of the time I hate people who try to teach me. Good to note that for me guidance is different.

So this is it for today for this was only to test the website and adjust. I plan and hope to not make the other posts not half as much personal. For the time being enjoy the idiotic gimmicks of the website, talk shit about me how this is pretentious...
